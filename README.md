Taste_of_honeypod is console-based application made for classes about Honey Pod.<br>
<br>
[How it works]<br>
<br>
1.On the first running, that says:<br>
'Let's look for your first Honey Pod.'<br>
'Making signiture file...'<br>
and creates Signiture.txt on the folder on which the app was run.<br>
<br>
2.On the second or more, that says 'Honey Pod Not Found.' unless Signiture.txt have been modified.<br>
<br>
3.When having been modified, says:
'Honey Pod Found!!' with the console turning white.<br>
<br>
The contents of Signiture.txt is 'Written by GIMEITAROU.'<br>
So adding modification to Signiture.txt is equal to saying the auther is not GIMEITAROU.<br>
Through this app, teachers can teach students this is how developers can detect malcious behavior.<br>
<br>
Taste_of_honeypod.exe is executable form of Taste_of_honeypod.py<br>
(built by Nuitka)<br>
Taste_of_honeypod is written in Python, so teachers can use the code running in cmd prompt or some.<br>
However, I rather reccomend running it in EXE form. The reason is below, but if you don't care about the reason, just ignore the next paragragh.<br>
<br>
The code works with relative path, so sometimes Signiture.txt can be lost in sight. I intensionally wrote in such way because limiting working folder can lead to user-unfriendly.<br>
<br>
If you trust me, download the EXE and use it.<br>
If do not, just build it by yourself.<br>
It's on you.<br>
<br>
Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to your using.
