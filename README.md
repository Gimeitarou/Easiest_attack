#Easiest_attack is coded with a wish that more and more kids get aware of capability of attacking system, it's funny and, without concensus, that's bad thing and makes creater of system sad or angury. And I want to teach them, there's ethical hackers who support our security.<br>
#I hope Easiest_attack utilized by teachers to tell kids attacking system is fun and ethical hacking is the key to our life supported by higher security.<br>

#Easiest_attack is console-based application. This app reply to us by only 2 ways:<br>
    Usualy,
         'This code is written by GIMEITAROU.'<br>
    When modified in the way that auther don't like:
        'crashed' with the console turning white.<br>
#Easiest_attack.exe is executable of Easiest_attack.py built by Nuitka.<br>
Of course, Easiest_attack is coded by python, so users can run the code in cmd prompt or some. You can use it in that way, but I rather reccomend use it in EXE form. The reason is below. If you don't care the reason, just jump next 3 paragraph.<br>
#When debugging, I sometimes lost [TEXT.txt]. The text file is the key to crack the app, that is what the app generate in the first execution. However, the app generate it on Current folder, I intensionaly did that. That is because I do not want this app or code running on only limited folder, so I decided it works in that way and I'll explain the reason and tell it's better to use it in executable form.<br>
#Executable form is not good from the point of security because users are rarely capable of knowing how it works and if capable few do it.<br>
#Anyway, I have good news. I have no capability of making devastigative malware nor spyware and I do not want my nick name, Gimeitarou famous for bad coder or developer.<br>
#If you don't trust me, just build it by nuitka by yourself. mightbe by PyInstaller. It's on you.<br>
<br>
#English is not my mother tong but I'm writting this without any translation tools because I wanna tell you my passion on this app.<br>
#I lease this app with a hope that I wrote in the first part.<br>
#Thanx a lot and hope you'll use this app.<br>
<br>
Demo video: not yet ready.<br>
What user(kids) to do : Run the EXE, and would find [TEXT.txt] generated. Next step is guess what modification would make auther get mad. And add the modification to [TEXT.txt], run the EXE, and check if that successed. Repeat these until that says 'crashed'.<br>
