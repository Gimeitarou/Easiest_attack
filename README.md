Easiest_hack is coded with a wish that more and more kids get interested in hacking and will become ethical hackers in the future.<br>
I hope Easiest_hack is utilized by teachers to tell kids hacking is fun and ethical hacking is the key to our life supported by higher security.<br>
<br>
Easiest_hack is console-based application. This app reply to us by only 2 ways:<br>
'This code is written by GIMEITAROU.' or<br>
'cracked, nice crack!!' following console turning white.<br>
Easiest_hack.exe is executable of Easiest_hack.py built by Nuitka.<br>
Of course, Easiest_hack is coded by python, so users can run the code in cmd prompt or some. You can use it in that way, but I rather reccomend use it in EXE form. The reason is below.<br>
When debugging, I sometimes lost [TEXT.txt]. The text file is the key to crack the app, that is what the app generate in the first execution. However, the app generate it on Current folder, I intensionaly did that. That is because I do not want this app or code running on only limited folder, so I decided it works in that way and I'll explain the reason and tell it's better to use it in executable form.<br>
Executable form is not good from the point of security because users are rarely capable of knowing how it works and if capable few do it.<br>
Anyway, I have good news. I have no capability of making devastigative malware nor spyware and I do not want My nick name, Gimeitarou famous for bad coder or developer.<br>
If you do not trust me, just build it by nuitka by yourself. mightbe by PyInstaller. It's on you.<br>
I'm a Japanese college student and wrote this README.md without any translation tools.(Not every README.md, actually)<br>
I wrote this with a hope that I wrote in the first part.<br>
Thanx a lot and hope you'll use this app.<br>
<br>
<br>Demo video: not yet ready.
<br>Remarks: Run the EXE, and you'll find [TEXT.txt] generated. And again run the EXE, rewrite [TEXT.txt], and repeat these until that says 'crashed'.<br>
